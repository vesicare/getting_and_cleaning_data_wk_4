##This describes script function and variables.

##The script "run_analysis.R" combines the Samsung data.
###Variables subjects and activity_lable are factor
##Set R working directory storing ”UCI HAR Dataset”.
##Sourcing “run_analysis.R” retuns an object named "tidy_data_set".
##Following intermediate objects are removed:
### step_1: a data set containing whole data from the training and the test sets
### step_2: the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
### step_3: step_2 with descriptive activity names.

##Variables and description:
